            <h1>Silence in the heart of the city’s chaos</h1>

            <p class="text">Join us for 1.5 hours of being quiet at the busiest spot in the city. Each participant will have two
            chairs and a large ‘be Silent with me’ sign, that invites passersby to join. We’ll sit together, yet
            apart—about 10-20 meters from one another. Afterwards, we’ll gather to share our experiences.</p>

            <h2>Why participate?</h2>
                <p class="text" id="participateText">Because silence is a basic human necessity.
                We often seek it in nature, in our rooms, or
                through noise-canceling headphones.
                But life is noisy, and we’re social
                beings who need connection. Instead of
                running from the chaos, we can train
                ourselves to embrace it. Silence and
                connection can be found anytime, anywhere,
                even in the midst of the city&#39;s busiest chaos. <br><br>
                See it as a personal challenge—to
                observe what happens when you’re silent in
                the heart of the everyday storm.</p>

            <h2>About the initiator</h2>
                <p class="text" id="initiatorText">My name is Ivar Verburg. As a kid, I learned
                to play the trumpet and eventually started my
                own band, Blaaskaak. My dream was to
                perform as much as possible, but by the time
                I was on stage several times a week, I was
                so overworked that it gave me no joy at all.<br>
                My goals kept growing faster than my
                accomplishments, leaving me in a state of
                constant running, never feeling good enough.
                The only solution was to quit everything.</p>
        </div>

        <p class="text">
            Thankfully a creative flow emerged from this space.
            <br>
            Suddenly I started drawing, writing poems,
            and making performance art, such as be Silent with me. Joy in performing with my band returned
            and I found a new balance in my life, with less performing and more silence and space. Of
            course I still feel pressure to become better, more successful, earn more money. But be Silent
            with me reminds me every time that there is no need to run. Silence can be found in the most chaotic places. It’s okay to stand still. I am good enough. We are good enough, right here, right
            now. / stilte leert ons wat we nodig hebben
